HydroQuebecAPI for Web Services Final Exam

This API works by having CRUD methods for 2 tables...

EmployeeTable & PowerOutageTable

These two tables have access to all CRUD/http methods.

These two tables contain all the information requested in the project outline.
There are model folders that are used to create objects ... I tried to create a library but maybe due to java version 11 
it kept breaking my build so I had to resort to in-house builds.

I use my repo class to access JPA methods that pass objects and service class to integrate those 
into methods that are then used in the controller classes.

I was unable to implement a final response but have created the model class & controller.

I also did not create any tests.

Other than thatr, postman included, form filled, java version 11 and all CRUD methods are accessbile in API.
API also has integration with H2 database through application.properties.

Thank you for everything, learned a lot in your course and it made me feel very passionate about the field.
It was honestly great to have someone teaching who actually works in the field.
Thank you sir have to end this short as I'm running out of time to submit!
